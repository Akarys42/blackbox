class YAMLGetter(type):
    """
    Metaclass for accessing yaml config data.

    Supports getting configuration from up to two levels
    of nested configuration through `section` and `subsection`.
    - `section` specifies the YAML configuration section (or "key") in which the configuration lives.
    - `subsection` specifies the section within the section from which configuration should be loaded.

    If neither are these are set, it'll just try to get it from the root level.

    Adapted from python-discord/bot.

    Example Usage:
        # config.yml
        bot:
            prefixes:
                direct_message: ''
                guild: '!'

        # config.py
        class Prefixes(metaclass=YAMLGetter):
            section = "bot"
            subsection = "prefixes"

        # Usage in Python code
        from config import Prefixes
